                        <h2>General Elden Ring Information</h2>
                        <p>Elden Ring is an upcoming action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. It is directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki, known for his work on the Souls series, and is set in a fantasy world created by Miyazaki and author George R. R.

                            <h2>George R. R. Martin</h2>
                            <p>George R. R. Martin, an American author who most notably wrote the Game of Thrones series, took some time away from the series to help Hidetaka Miyazaki write the story for Elden Ring. The story takes a lonely Tarnished (the player) and puts them on a quest for the Elden Ring. The realm of The Lands Between is in utter chaos. Power-hungry gods, demi-gods, and demons are in search of the power to control the land. It's all up to the Tarnished to restore order to the land.</p>

                            <p>Elden Ring won many gaming awards including the prestigious 2022 Game of the Year award. Just to name a few: Best Game Direction, Best Art Direction, Best RPG of the Year. When I first played Elden Ring I was stunned by the sheer quality and beauty of the game. There were too many times that I was playing and I just had to stop and take in the beautiful atmosphere that I was in.</p>

                            <p>The Hero is the perfect Hack'n slash character. The Hero's main two attributes are Health and Strength.</p>

                            <p>The bandit is a light fast character. The bandit focuses on dexterity and arcane. Great for elemental build types. Just don't get hit while playing the bandit!</p>

                            <p>The main spell-caster of the group. The astrologer is a glass cannon, does incredible damage but has no health. Keep your distance!</p>
                        </div>

                            <p>The Warrior is a pure dexterity type. Great class if you want to dual wield swords, axes, or katanas!</p>

                            <p>The prisoner is an interesting character. The only other character to start off with high intelligence. He can cast spells like the astrologer but also has a straight sword for close combat.</p>

                            <p>The Confessor focuses on Faith/Strength builds. This would be a perfect starting character for a Holy Paladin!</p>

                            <p>The Wretch is for the experienced players who would like to create their character from scratch instead of having preset attributes. Very fun, but the start of the game is much harder this way.</p>

                            <p>The Vagabond is the tank of the group. Great starting health and great starting damage. If you want to swing around the biggest swords and hammers in the game choose the Vagabond!</p>

                            <p>The prophet is another mage type. The prophet specializes in Faith, faith magic is magic from your body not a staff. This includes fireballs, lighting spears, and so many buffs that you can apply to yourself.</p>

                            <p>The Samurai gets up close and personal. No magic attributes but the Samurai is strong, has great health, and has tons of endurance. The Samurai also carries a long bow for long-ranged attacks.</p>

                            <p>Hey Guys! I stream on Twitch every so often! Lately I've been streaming more due to the fact that the DLC is dropping soon. I started a new character and I've been trying to stream all the big boss fights. It's a good time! We have some fun commentary with tons of laughs! Come watch while this run through lasts! The schedule is quite sporadic but I have been pretty constant on Thursday nights! Here's a link to my Twitch channel!</p>

                            <p>Hello fellow Tarnished! Glad to see that you've found yourself at my website! I've been playing Elden Ring for about two years now and I've gone through the game five times now. If anyone needs help with specific bosses or just wants to play around with me, please shoot me a message on Xbox! My gamertag is bigbird295. With a couple of days' notice I can be free to hop on whenever and help!</p>

                            <p>Just thought I would share some of my Elden Ring stats! My first playthrough I played as an Astrologer. It was my first From FromSoftware game so I didn't know what to expect. I chose the astrologer so that I could play from a distance and negate most of the hand-to-hand combat. Playing as a mage was great fun and I ended up playing up to new game plus 3 with that character. My next playthrough I decided to play as another mage the prophet! The prophet was fun and the playstyle was very similar to the astrologer just with some new type of magic and some new weapons. I was actually able to get closer in combat and kill some bosses without magic in this playthrough. The character I'm currently playing and using on stream is a wretch. I created a character from scratch and I've only been upgrading Strength and Vigor(health). I use a giant stone hammer and I'm having the time of my life with it. The strength build definitely feels more satisfying when I kill bosses because I actually have to learn their moveset. Love this game and can't wait for the DLC!</p>
