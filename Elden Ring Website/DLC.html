                        <h2>News!</h2>
                        <p>Two years after the release of Elden Ring, the DLC is finally coming! On June 21st the DLC will be out! Not much is known about what level each character will start out as but
                            it will be great. I believe that no matter what level you are going into the dlc the enemies will be scaled to your character. The dlc is going to be 12GB compared to the base game
                            which is 48GB. Miyazaki said that the dlc map will be larger than Limgrave. So if we put that into perspective it would be from the most southern tip of Limgrave 
                            all the way up to Godricks castle. Pretty decent size if you ask me. Here is a link to the DLC trailer!

                        <h2>Messmer The Impaler</h2>
                        <p>The dlc is centered around this enemy Messmer The Impaler. Little is know about him but we have confirmed that this is not
                            Melenia's brother. Which kind of makes me sad. However Miyazaki said that this boss battle probably won't be to the same scale as the Melania
                            fight but that there will be other bosses not part of the main story that will be hard. Knowing FromSoftware dlcs some of the hardest bosses 
                            of the series comes from the dlc, so it should be a lot of fun!
