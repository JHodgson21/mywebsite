                        <p> Hey Guys! I stream on Twitch every so often! Lately I've been streaming more due to the fact
                            that the DLC is dropping soon. I started a new character and I've been trying to stream all the big boss fights.
                            It's a good time! We have some fun commentary with tons of laughs! Come watch while this run through lasts! The schedule is quite
                            sporadic but I have been pretty constant on Thursday nights! Here's a link to my Twitch channel!

                        <p>Hello fellow Tarnished! Glad to see that you've found yourself at my website! I've been
                            playing Elden Ring for about two years now and I've gone through the game five times now.
                            If anyone needs help with specific bosses or just wants to play around with me, please shoot me a
                            message on Xbox! My gamertag is bigbird295. With a couple days notice I can be free to hop on
                            whenever and help!
                        </p>

                        <p>Just thought I would share some of my Elden Ring stats! My first playthrough I played as an Astrologer. It was my first From FromSoftware
                            game so I didn't know what to expect. I chose the astrologer so that I could play from a distance and negate most of the hand-to-hand combat.
                            Playing as a mage was great fun and I ended up playing up to new game plus 3 with that character. My next playthrough I decided to play as
                            other mage the prophet! The prophet was fun andn the playstyle was very similar to the astrologer just with some new type of magic and some new 
                            weapons. I was actually able to get closer in combat and kill some bosses without magic in this playthrough. The character I'm currently playing
                            and using on stream is a wretch. I created a character from scratch and I've only been upgrading Strength and Vigor(health). I use a giant
                            stone hammer and I'm having the time of my life with it. The strength build definately feels more satisfying when I kill bosses because I actually
                            have to learn their moveset. Love this game and can't wait for the DLC!
