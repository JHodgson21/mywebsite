                            control the land. It's all up to the Tarnished to restore order to the land.

                            When I first played Elden Ring I was stunned by the sure quality and beauty of the game.
                            There were too many times that I was playing and I just had to stop and take in the beautiful 
                            atmosphere that I was in.
